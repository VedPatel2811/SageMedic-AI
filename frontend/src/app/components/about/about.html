        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          At SageMedic AI, we believe that everyone deserves access to reliable
          health information. Our mission is to bridge the gap between patients
          and medical knowledge through cutting-edge artificial intelligence
          technology, providing instant, accurate, and personalized health
          insights while maintaining the highest standards of privacy and
          security.
        </p>
        <p>
          We understand that our AI-powered symptom checker is a tool for
          information and education, not a replacement for professional medical
          care. We always encourage users to consult with qualified healthcare
          providers for proper diagnosis and treatment.
